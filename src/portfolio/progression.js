                        <p>I did my Undergraduate studies at the prestigious Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) where I qualified for my Bachelor’s education specializing in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. My passion towards engineering and consistent academic performance helped me earn 5th rank in my class of 180 excellent students</p>
                        <p>I took courses on "Problem Solving and Programming", "Objest Oriented Programming" complimenting it with MOOCs from Coursera on "Java Programming"</p>
                        <p>I was able to explore more than it was taught in the classroom. Apart from the prescribed fundamental data structures, I went ahead to understand more about the advanced data structures like Linked List, Graphs, Trees (AVL), etc</p>

                        <p>This was a beautiful amalgamation of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. We took an Electrical engineering problem and applied computer science concepts to solve it. The paper proposed a hybrid Borvuka’s-Floyd Warshall’s Algorithm for identifying active DG’s, loads, and main grid in the network. The algorithms find the shortest path to clear the fault by identifying the cheapest path between faulted point and utility grid. In this way healthy portion of system is isolated from faulted portion</p>
